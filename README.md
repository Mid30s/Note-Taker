## Description

The note taker project is a web application that allows users to create, save, and delete notes. It is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework.

My motivation for building this project was to improve my understanding of server-side programming and web development. I wanted to practice building a RESTful API, handling HTTP requests and responses, and serving static HTML pages.

The note taker project solves the problem of having to remember important information by providing a convenient and accessible platform for taking notes. Users can easily create and store notes on the server, and retrieve or delete them as needed. This makes it easier to keep track of tasks, ideas, and other important information.

Through building this project, I learned about the importance of creating modular and organized code, separating concerns, and using middleware to handle HTTP requests and responses. I also gained experience with routing, file I/O operations, and working with JSON data. Additionally, I learned how to deploy an Express.js application to a cloud platform such as Heroku. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that improved my skills as a web developer.
